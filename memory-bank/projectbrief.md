# Project Brief: t3a-videoblade

## Project Identity

**Name**: t3a-videoblade  
**Type**: Full-stack web application  
**Framework**: T3 Stack (Next.js + tRPC + Prisma + NextAuth)  
**Status**: Foundation established, awaiting feature implementation

## Core Purpose

A web application built on the T3 Stack that will implement video-related functionality. The project name "videoblade" suggests video processing, management, or streaming capabilities.

## Current Scope

### Established Foundation

- Modern Next.js 15 application with App Router
- Type-safe API layer using tRPC
- Database integration with Prisma ORM (SQLite)
- Authentication system with NextAuth.js
- Responsive UI with Tailwind CSS
- TypeScript for full type safety

### Planned Features

_To be defined based on project requirements_

The "videoblade" functionality is not yet implemented. This could include:

- Video upload and storage
- Video processing/editing capabilities
- Video streaming
- Video management/organization
- Video metadata handling
- User video libraries

## Technical Requirements

### Must Have

- ✅ Next.js 15+ (App Router)
- ✅ Type-safe API (tRPC)
- ✅ Database ORM (Prisma)
- ✅ User authentication (NextAuth.js)
- ✅ Modern styling (Tailwind CSS)
- ✅ TypeScript support

### Future Considerations

- Video processing libraries
- Cloud storage integration
- Video streaming capabilities
- Media transcoding
- CDN integration

## Success Criteria

### Foundation (Current Phase)

- ✅ T3 Stack properly configured
- ✅ Authentication system working
- ✅ Database schema defined
- ✅ Development environment ready

### Feature Implementation (Next Phase)

_To be defined when videoblade features are specified_

## Constraints

- Using SQLite for development (may need migration for production)
- NextAuth.js 5.0 beta (stable patterns needed)
- Modern browser support required (React 19)

## Non-Goals

- Not a video hosting platform like YouTube
- Not focused on live streaming (unless specified)
- Not a video conferencing tool

## Notes

This project was bootstrapped with `create-t3-app` (v7.40.0) and includes all the standard T3 Stack components. The specific video-related functionality ("videoblade") needs to be defined and implemented as the next phase of development.
